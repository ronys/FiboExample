This project roughly follows Kent Beck's Fibonacci Example as
described in Appendix II of his "Test-Driven Development by Example" book.
The main differences are due to the code being written in C++ rather
than Java, and using the GoogleTest test framework.
This has been developed under Linux, but should be straightforward to
adopt to other platforms. The only external dependency (aside from C++
std stuff) is the gTest framework, which is pointed to in the
Makefile.
